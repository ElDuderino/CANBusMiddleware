## API Sensor Types ##

These are json files we'll use as initial references for creating the sensortypedocs in the BO datastore. 

Once they're added to the API, the API will become the ground truth for the sensor type metadata for these types. 

You can access that data at: https://iot.aretas.ca/rest/sensortype/list

As of Feb 24/2023 all types except Shunts and Cell Voltages have been added.
